# final-project
Outpatient Procedures USA - 2014
Our project is based on hospital databases that display hospitals with
corresponding types of outpatient procedures in order to show
trends and correlations between area, illnesses, and procedures performed.
(Our project can be open by the computer and open in the browser when you run the app, it just take a long time since we have a large database, however, since the database is too large, when it publish on shiny, it may often show the problem of "disconnect to the server, which is normal" )

This is our shiny app: https://chendiva.shinyapps.io/final-project/
